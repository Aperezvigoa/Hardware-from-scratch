# Digital Logic & Hardware Design Notes

This repository contains structured notes and resources related to digital logic and hardware design using HDL (Hardware Description Language). The content primarily follows the foundations laid out in the first half of the "Nand to Tetris" course, with a focus on building computation from the ground up.

## Overview

The goal of this documentation is to reinforce core concepts in computer architecture through:

- Clean and modular HDL implementations of logic gates and chips
- Diagrams, truth tables, and architecture breakdowns
- Explanations of gate-level abstractions and composite chip design
- Progressive exploration from NAND logic to basic ALU components and memory systems

---

## Topics Covered

- Elementary logic gates: NAND, AND, OR, NOT
- Composite gates: Mux, DMux, Adders, etc.
- Combinational logic
- Sequential logic (planned)
- 16-bit ALU (planned)
- Basic memory chips (planned)

Each module includes structured notes, visual references, and, where applicable, HDL implementations.

## Tools & Format

- HDL code is written following the Hack platform conventions
- Markdown used for all documentation to ensure clarity and accessibility
